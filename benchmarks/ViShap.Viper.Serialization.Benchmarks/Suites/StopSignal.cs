/// <remarks>
/// Ctrl+C is read as a key rather than received as a signal. A signal reaches every process on the
/// console — the BenchmarkDotNet child measuring the current cell among them — and BenchmarkDotNet's
/// own handler kills that child, so a signal could never mean "finish the suite". With
/// <see cref="Console.TreatControlCAsInput"/> set, no process on the console gets a signal, and the run
/// decides what the key means. When standard input is not a console the key cannot be read; Ctrl+C then
/// keeps its usual meaning, and the <c>STOP</c> file is the way to ask for a stop.
